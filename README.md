## Installation

### Local Development

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monad-ide.git
cd monad-ide
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file with your configuration:

```env
# AI provider — at least one is needed for generate/audit/explain/research.
# Compile, deploy and transfer work without any of these.
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

# Optional: Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key

# Optional: Deployment
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Deployment

MonadStudio can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any Node.js hosting platform.

For Vercel:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

Add environment variables through your hosting platform's dashboard.

## Configuration

### AI Provider Setup

**Groq** (Recommended)
- Fast inference with free tier available
- Sign up at console.groq.com
- Generate API key in dashboard
- Add `GROQ_API_KEY` to environment variables

**OpenAI** (Alternative)
- Higher quality responses for complex tasks
- Requires paid API access
- Create key at platform.openai.com
- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to environment variables

### Supabase (Optional)

For analytics and deployment tracking:
1. Create project at supabase.com
2. Execute SQL schema from `supabase/schema.sql`
3. Copy project URL and anon key to environment variables

## Usage

### Writing Contracts

The IDE provides three ways to start:

1. **From Template** - Select from pre-built contracts (ERC20, NFT, DAO, Staking)
2. **AI Generation** - Describe requirements in natural language
3. **Blank File** - Write Solidity code from scratch

The Monaco editor includes:
- Syntax highlighting for Solidity
- Autocomplete for language keywords
- Error underlining
- Code folding and minimap

### Compilation

Click the Compile button to build your contract. The system:
- Resolves OpenZeppelin imports automatically
- Runs Solidity compiler with optimization
- Generates ABI and bytecode
- Reports errors with line numbers and descriptions

If AI features are enabled, compilation errors include contextual explanations and suggestions.

### Security Auditing

The Audit button triggers analysis that checks for:
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Integer overflow/underflow risks
- Access control issues
- Unsafe external calls
- Gas optimization opportunities

Results include severity ratings and remediation recommendations.

### Parallel Analysis

The Parallel Profiler analyzes contracts for Monad-specific optimizations:

1. Maps storage variable access patterns
2. Identifies read/write conflicts between functions
3. Calculates parallelization potential
4. Generates dependency graph visualization
5. Provides optimization suggestions

This helps you write contracts that leverage Monad's parallel execution architecture.

### Deployment

To deploy a contract:

1. Ensure the contract compiles successfully
2. Connect MetaMask wallet
3. Select target network (Monad Testnet or Mainnet)
4. Click Deploy
5. Confirm transaction in MetaMask
6. Receive contract address and explorer link

## Monad Network

MonadStudio is built for Monad, an EVM-compatible blockchain with 10,000 TPS throughput via parallel execution.

**Network Configuration**

| Network | Chain ID | RPC Endpoint |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Testnet | 10143 | https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz |
| Mainnet | 10143 | https://mainnet-rpc.monad.xyz |

**Adding to MetaMask**

The IDE prompts for network addition during deployment. Manual configuration:

- Network Name: Monad Testnet
- RPC URL: https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz
- Chain ID: 10143
- Currency Symbol: MON

**Parallel Execution**

Monad's architecture executes transactions in parallel rather than sequentially. The Parallel Profiler helps identify:
- Functions that can execute concurrently
- Storage dependencies that create conflicts
- Optimization opportunities for higher throughput
